chuck version: 1.5.5.0 (chai)
   Microsoft Windows | 64-bit
   audio drivers: ASIO | DirectSound | WASAPI

## Overview
This project explores psychedelic audio manipulation, transforming any spoken input into an immersive soundscape. Filters, reverb, panning, and generative synthesis alter perception, making everything sound surreal.

## How to Run  
0.(optional)Change audio_file.wav to your own voice wav file
1. Open `main.ck` with miniAudicle
2.Start VM
3. Add the shred  

## Files and Features  

 File & Function 

| main.ck |
 Loads and manages all components (`Machine.add`) 

| audio1.1.ck |
This script defines an `AudioPlayer` class that plays an audio file in a loop. With each repeat, the volume decreases and reverb increases, creating a fading, immersive effect.
Features:
- LPF and JCRev processing
- Ternary operator for safe parameter control
- `Math.pow()` used to scale gain over time
- Runs for 4 minutes with sporked playback
Ideal for experimental or ambient audio projects.

| basetempo.ck | 
This script features object-oriented audio synthesis with reverb and delay effects.
Highlights:
- Custom `EffectProcessor`, `BassSynth`, and subclasses (`SynthBass`, `LeadSynth`)
- Multiple oscillators: sine, square, triangle
- Melody and bass lines run in parallel with `spork`
- Demonstrates arrays, subclassing, and multithreaded playback

| chord1.1.ck | 
Creates evolving harmonies by function overloading 

| panning.ck| 
Jumping sound to create spatial effects (dynamic panning) 

| stktest.ck | 
Uses randomly generated STK synthesis for some random noise sound design(I only used two of them for better musical side. Feel free to uncomment each of them for exploring.)

## Implementation  
- Audio Processing: LPF, reverb, STK synthesis  
- Object-Oriented Design: 3+ classes, function overloading, subclassing  
- Concurrency: Uses `Machine.add`, `spork`, and 4+ shreds  

## Concept  
This project warps speech into surreal sound. Music and effects bend meaning—proving that perception is as fluid as sound.

The script of the default audio:

Right now, you’re listening to something. Some elegant noise, generated by ChucK.
A machine moving air, flipping ones and zeros, pretending to be sound.

And yet… you feel something.

Curious, isn’t it?
A series of electrical pulses, stitched together into waves, now stirring something inside you.
Your reaction is real. Undeniably real.

But step back for a second.
What is ‘real’, when all it takes is a handful of numbers to make you feel?
