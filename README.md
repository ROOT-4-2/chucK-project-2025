# chucK-project-2025
# 🎛️ Interactive Object-Oriented ChucK Application

**ChucK Version:** 1.5.5.0 (chai)  
**Platform:** Windows 64-bit  
**Audio Drivers:** ASIO / DirectSound / WASAPI  
🔗 [ChucK Official Site](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/) • [Stanford Site](http://chuck.stanford.edu/)

## 🌀 Overview

This project explores **psychedelic audio manipulation**, transforming any spoken input into an immersive soundscape.  
Filters, reverb, panning, and generative synthesis alter perception — making anything sound surreal.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. *(Optional)* Replace `audio_file.wav` with your own recorded `.wav` file  
2. Open `main.ck` in **miniAudicle**  
3. Start the Virtual Machine (VM)  
4. Add `main.ck` as a shred

## 📁 Files and Features

| File           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`main.ck`**        | Controls and loads all components via `Machine.add` |
| **`audio1.1.ck`**    | Defines `AudioPlayer` class that loops audio. Each repeat lowers volume and increases reverb.<br>• LPF & JCRev processing<br>• `Math.pow()` gain scaling<br>• Ternary operator for clamping<br>• Runs for 4 minutes |
| **`basetempo.ck`**   | Object-oriented synthesis with reverb/delay effects.<br>• Classes: `EffectProcessor`, `BassSynth`, `LeadSynth`<br>• Oscillators: sine, square, triangle<br>• Uses `spork` for parallel melody/bass |
| **`chord1.1.ck`**    | Uses function overloading to generate evolving harmonies |
| **`panning.ck`**     | Simulates spatial movement via dynamic stereo panning |
| **`stktest.ck`**     | Demonstrates random STK instruments for experimental textures<br>*(only 2 are used, others can be explored by uncommenting)* |

## 🛠 Implementation

- **Audio Processing:** LPF, reverb, feedback delay, STK synthesis  
- **OOP Techniques:** 3+ custom classes, function overloading, subclassing  
- **Concurrency:** Uses `Machine.add`, `spork`, and multiple shreds

## 💡 Concept

> This project warps speech into surreal sound.  
> Music and effects bend meaning — proving that **perception is as fluid as sound**.

## 🎧 Default Audio Script

Right now, you’re listening to something. Some elegant noise, generated by ChucK. A machine moving air, flipping ones and zeros, pretending to be sound.

And yet… you feel something.

Curious, isn’t it? A series of electrical pulses, stitched together into waves, now stirring something inside you. Your reaction is real. Undeniably real.

But step back for a second. What is ‘real’, when all it takes is a handful of numbers to make you feel?
